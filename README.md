## How To Use
You Can Use the website to bypass GeyserMC's Authentication form on where Floodgate is Not Installed and if you don't have java account. 
However, this is still under construction.

Method 1: This Only Works in NogyangSpigot For Minecraft 1.20.6 Using ViaVersion and Geyser Before GeyserMC#4147(https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/4147).
click Password login
type nogyangserver.u{YOURUSERNAME}@mail.nogyang.ms.kr + nogyangserver passcode.
Method 2: 
Use geyserauth.nogyang.ms.kr and input the auth code there.
do not use Microsoft acc -> web login's website.
